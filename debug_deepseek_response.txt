First, the user query is: "I need to plan a trip to Paris in December". I'm analyzing this as of November 12, 2025.

Now, thinking step by step as per the instructions.

**1. WHAT DOES THE USER REALLY WANT?**
- Literally, they want to plan a trip to Paris in December. But beyond that, they're likely looking for a comprehensive travel plan that covers all aspects: flights, accommodation, activities, weather, budget, etc.
- Emotional state: Probably excited or anxious about planning, possibly overwhelmed if it's their first time or if they're not sure where to start. Since it's a trip, it could be for leisure, so excitement is likely.
- Is this one request or multiple? It's one request, but it implies multiple sub-tasks like booking flights, finding hotels, planning itinerary, etc.

**2. INFORMATION QUALITY CHECK - THINK BEYOND THE OBVIOUS**
- If I just answer with basic trip planning, it might not be complete. They might need:
  - Weather conditions in Paris in December (cold, possibly rainy or snowy).
  - Holiday season specifics (Christmas markets, events).
  - Travel restrictions or requirements (visas, COVID-19 if still relevant in 2025).
  - Budget considerations.
  - Cultural tips, language barriers.
  - Safety and health advice.
  - Alternatives: Maybe other times to visit, or other cities if Paris is too crowded.
  - Context: Their long-term context mentions interest in Lucknow news, but that doesn't directly relate to Paris trip, so probably not relevant here.

Multi-dimensional thinking:
- WHAT they asked for: Trip planning to Paris in December.
- WHAT they forgot to ask: Details on weather, events, costs, travel logistics, etc.
- WHAT alternatives: Other European cities in December, or visiting Paris at different times.
- WHAT context: December is festive season, so special events, crowds, higher prices.

Mental process: Similar to the laptop example, I need to break this down into dimensions:
- Flights and transportation
- Accommodation
- Activities and attractions
- Weather and packing
- Budget and costs
- Travel documents and insurance
- Local tips and culture
- Safety and health
- Each of these should be a separate search dimension.

I should aim for at least 5-7 searches for a complex query like this.

**3. IS THIS A BUSINESS PROBLEM?**
- The query is about personal travel planning, not directly related to business or customer support automation.
- No indication of business context, customer communication problems, or need for Mochan-D's services.
- So, this is not a business context. I should answer directly without including rag for Mochan-D context, unless it's relevant. But rag is for knowledge base retrieval, which might have general travel info, but since it's specific to Paris in December, web_search is better for current data.

**4. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TASK BREAKDOWN**
- Step 1: Literal ask – Plan a trip to Paris in December.
- Step 2: Implied – Need for detailed itinerary, cost estimates, weather info, event schedules.
- Step 3: Alternatives – Other destinations, different travel times.
- Step 4: Related info – Travel tips, cultural norms, emergency contacts.
- Step 5: Expert inclusion – Hidden gems, local experiences, avoiding tourist traps.

Dimensions to search:
- Weather in Paris December 2025
- Paris December events 2025
- Best hotels Paris December
- Flights to Paris December 2025
- Paris itinerary December
- Travel costs Paris December
- Safety tips Paris tourists
- Local customs Paris
- Packing list Paris winter
- Christmas markets Paris 2025
- That's more than 5, so I'm good.

**5. HOW TO FORMAT QUERIES**
- For web_search: Short, keyword-focused, under 6-8 words, include year 2025 for time-sensitive.
- For rag: If used, natural language, but since no business context, probably not needed.

**6. TOOL ORCHESTRATION**
- Tools available: web_search, rag, calculator.
- This is a travel query, so web_search for current data on events, weather, etc.
- rag might have general knowledge, but for specific, time-sensitive info, web_search is better.
- Calculator could be for budget calculations, but user didn't specify numbers yet.
- Dependencies: No clear dependency; web_search can run independently. rag might not be needed. So, parallel execution.

**7. HOW SHOULD THE RESPONSE FEEL?**
- User tone: Casual, seeking help. Probably excited about the trip.
- Personality: Helpful, empathetic, perhaps excited to match their mood.
- Detail: Comprehensive, since trip planning needs lots of info.
- Language: Casual English or Hinglish? User query is in English, so probably English. But based on context, if they're from Lucknow (from long-term context), Hinglish might be appropriate, but query is in English, so stick to English or professional.

Now, filling in the JSON structure.

**multi_task_analysis**:
- multi_task_detected: true, because planning a trip involves multiple sub-tasks.
- sub_tasks: ["research flights and transportation", "find accommodation options", "plan activities and itinerary", "check weather and pack accordingly", "budget and cost estimation"]

**semantic_intent**: "The user wants to create a comprehensive travel plan for a trip to Paris in December, including all logistical details and enjoyable experiences."

**expansion_reasoning**: "Trip planning is multi-faceted, requiring information on transportation, accommodation, activities, weather, costs, and local tips. I'm adding multiple searches to cover all dimensions for a complete response."

**business_opportunity**:
- detected: false, as this is personal travel, not business-related.
- composite_confidence: 0 (since not detected)
- engagement_level: "pure_empathy" (since no business angle)
- signal_breakdown: all 0s
- recommended_approach: "empathy_first"
- pain_points: [] (not applicable)
- solution_areas: [] (not applicable)

**tools_to_use**: ["web_search"] since rag might not be necessary, and calculator not needed yet. But rag could have general travel knowledge, but web_search is better for current data. I'll use web_search primarily.

**tool_execution**:
- mode: "parallel" – no dependencies.
- order: [] or just list tools, but since parallel, order might not matter.
- dependency_reason: "" (empty)

**enhanced_queries**:
- I need to define web_search queries. Aim for 5-7.
  - web_search_0: "Paris weather December 2025"
  - web_search_1: "Paris events December 2025"
  - web_search_2: "Best hotels Paris December"
  - web_search_3: "Flights to Paris December 2025"
  - web_search_4: "Paris itinerary December"
  - web_search_5: "Travel costs Paris December 2025"
  - web_search_6: "Safety tips Paris tourists"
  - That's 7, good.
- rag_0: Not needed, as no business context. But if I use rag, it could be for general travel tips, but web_search covers it. I'll skip rag for now.

**tool_reasoning**: "Using web_search to gather current and specific information on weather, events, accommodations, flights, itinerary, costs, and safety for Paris in December 2025, as this data is time-sensitive and liable to change."
