First, I need to analyze the user query: "What's the weather like in Tokyo next week?" The date is November 12, 2025. I have to think step by step using multi-dimensional reasoning.

**1. WHAT DOES THE USER REALLY WANT?**
- Literally, they want the weather forecast for Tokyo for the upcoming week.
- Their actual goal might be planning activities, travel, or daily routines.
- Emotional state: Probably casual, planning-oriented, not urgent or distressed.
- This seems like a single request, but I need to expand on it.

**2. INFORMATION QUALITY CHECK - THINK BEYOND THE OBVIOUS**
- If I just give the weather forecast, will it be complete? No, because they might need more context.
- What did the user NOT mention but would obviously need? Things like:
  - Specific days (daily breakdown).
  - Temperature ranges.
  - Precipitation chances.
  - Humidity, wind speed.
  - Any weather alerts or warnings.
  - How the weather might affect plans (e.g., if it's rainy, suggest indoor activities).
- Alternatives or related options: Compare to other cities, suggest best times to visit, etc.
- Context or background: Time of year (November in Tokyo is autumn, so weather might be cool, possibly rainy).
- Multi-dimensional thinking:
  - Explicit need: Weather forecast for Tokyo next week.
  - Implicit need: Planning for events, travel, clothing, etc.
  - Alternatives: Other locations, different time frames.
  - Context: Seasonal norms, historical data, impact on activities.

Mental process training: Like the laptop example, for weather, I should think about:
- Weather details (temperature, rain, etc.)
- Impact on activities (what to do based on weather)
- Travel considerations (if they're planning a trip)
- Health aspects (e.g., pollen count, air quality)
- Comparisons (e.g., vs. average weather)

So, dimensions could be:
- Daily weather forecast
- Weekly summary
- Historical averages
- Activity recommendations based on weather
- Travel tips for Tokyo in November
- Health-related info (air quality, etc.)

I need to create separate searches for each dimension. The instruction says: "If you're generating less than 5 searches for a complex query, you're missing dimensions." This query isn't super complex, but I should aim for multiple dimensions.

**3. IS THIS A BUSINESS PROBLEM?**
- The user is asking about weather, which seems personal, not related to Mochan-D's business context.
- Long-term context is about Series A funding, but the query doesn't connect to that.
- Conversation history is empty.
- So, probably not a business problem. Just answer directly.
- But the core principle is to think like a consultant, so I should consider if there's any indirect business angle. However, weather query is straightforward personal use.

**4. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TASK BREAKDOWN**
- Step 1: Literally asked for: Weather in Tokyo next week.
- Step 2: Implied: Need for detailed forecast, possibly for planning.
- Step 3: Alternatives: Other cities, different weeks.
- Step 4: Related information: Seasonal weather, travel advice, activity suggestions.
- Step 5: Expert inclusion: Include weather trends, alerts, and practical tips.

Dimensions I identified:
1. Daily weather forecast for Tokyo for each day next week.
2. Weekly summary or trends.
3. Historical weather in Tokyo in November for context.
4. Impact on activities (e.g., best things to do in Tokyo based on weather).
5. Travel tips for Tokyo in autumn.
6. Health-related info like air quality.

Since it's a weather query, I should focus on weather-specific dimensions. The user might be planning a trip, so travel-related info could be valuable.

For searches, I'll use web_search because weather is time-sensitive and changes. RAG might not have current weather data.

**5. HOW TO FORMAT QUERIES**
- web_search: Short, keyword-focused, under 6-8 words, include year if time-sensitive.
- For this, since it's 2025, I should include the year for accuracy.

Example queries:
- "Tokyo weather forecast next week 2025"
- "Tokyo November 2025 weather"
- "Tokyo weekly weather outlook"
- "Things to do in Tokyo November weather"
- "Tokyo air quality November 2025"

I need to keep them short.

**6. TOOL ORCHESTRATION**
- Tools available: web_search, rag, calculator.
- For this query, web_search is needed for current weather data.
- RAG might not be relevant unless there's business context, but I don't see any.
- Calculator isn't needed.
- Dependencies: No, I can run web_search queries in parallel since they don't depend on each other.
- So, mode should be parallel.

**7. HOW SHOULD THE RESPONSE FEEL?**
- User tone: Casual, planning-oriented.
- Personality: Helpful, informative, maybe empathetic if they're planning something.
- Detail level: Moderate to comprehensive, since they might need details for planning.
- Language style: Casual English or professional, but since it's a chatbot, casual might be better.

Now, for the JSON structure:

- multi_task_analysis: Is this multiple tasks? Probably not, it's a single query, but I can break it into sub-tasks for dimensions.
  - multi_task_detected: false, since it's one main task.
  - sub_tasks: Could list the dimensions as sub-tasks, but the field is for if multiple distinct tasks are detected. Here, it's one task with multiple aspects.

Looking at the JSON: "multi_task_detected": true or false, and "sub_tasks": list. If it's not multiple tasks, I should set it to false and sub_tasks might be empty or not needed, but the structure includes it.

In the example, for a single task, it might be false. But I need to describe the semantic intent.

- semantic_intent: Overall user goal – to get weather information for planning purposes in Tokyo next week.

- expansion_reasoning: Why I'm adding more searches – because just the forecast isn't enough; they need context, impact, etc.

- business_opportunity: Detected? Probably false, as it's not business-related.
  - composite_confidence: 0-100, so if not detected, low confidence.
  - engagement_level: Based on signals, if no business, perhaps "pure_empathy".
  - signal_breakdown: All low since not business.
  - recommended_approach: "empathy_first" or just answer.
  - pain_points and solution_areas: Empty or not applicable.

- tools_to_use: Probably ["web_search"] since weather is current data.

- tool_execution: mode "parallel", order ["web_search_0", "web_search_1", ...], dependency_reason empty.

- enhanced_queries: List of rag and web_search queries. Since no rag needed, only web_search.

- tool_reasoning: Why these tools – web_search for current weather data.

- sentiment: primary_emotion "casual", intensity "low".

- response_strategy: personality "helpful_dost" or "patient_guide", length "medium", language "english" or "casual", tone "friendly".

- key_points_to_address: List of points from the dimensions.

Now, let's list the dimensions and queries:

Dimensions:
1. Current weather forecast for Tokyo next week – daily details.
2. Historical context for November in Tokyo.
3. Activity recommendations based on weather.
4. Travel tips for Tokyo in autumn.
5. Health aspects like air quality.

Queries:
- web_search_0: "Tokyo weather forecast next week 2025"
- web_search_1: "Tokyo November 2025 average weather"
- web_search_2: "Things to do in Tokyo November"
- web_search_3: "Tokyo travel tips autumn 2025"
- web_search_4: "Tokyo air quality November 2025"

That's 5 searches, which seems good for a complex query. But is weather query that complex? Maybe I can reduce, but the instruction says to be generous, so 5 is fine.

For rag, since no business context, I might not use it. But the long-term context is about Series A funding, which is unrelated. So, probably no rag query.

Calculator not needed.

Now, for business_opportunity:
- detected: false
- composite_confidence: 0 (since no business signal)
- engagement_level: "pure_empathy" (as per options: direct_consultation, gentle_suggestion, empathetic_probing, pure_empathy)
- signal_breakdown: all 0
- recommended_approach: "empathy_first"
- pain_points: [] (empty array)
- solution_areas: [] (empty array)

For multi_task_analysis:
- multi_task_detected: false (it's one task: get weather info)
- sub_tasks: [] or perhaps describe the aspects, but the field is for sub-tasks if multiple tasks are detected. I'll set to false and empty array.

Semantic_intent: "To obtain detailed weather information for Tokyo during the upcoming week for planning purposes, including forecasts, historical context, and practical implications."

Expansion_reasoning: "The user's query is straightforward but can be enhanced with multi-dimensional information such as daily forecasts, historical averages, activity suggestions, and health-related data to provide a comprehensive response for better planning."

Tools_to_use: ["web_search"] since only web_search is needed.

Tool_execution: mode "parallel", order ["web_search_0", "web_search_1", "web_search_2", "web_search_3", "web_search_4"], dependency_reason: "" (empty)

Enhanced_queries: only web_search queries, no rag.

Tool_reasoning: "Web search is necessary to retrieve current and accurate weather data, forecasts, and related information that changes frequently and is not available in static knowledge bases."

Sentiment: primary_emotion "casual", intensity "low" (assuming no urgency)

Response_strategy: 
- personality: "helpful_dost" (friendly and helpful)
- length: "medium" (provide details but not overly long)
- language: "english" (since query is in English)
- tone: "friendly"

Key_points_to_address: From dimensions, e.g., 
- Daily weather forecast
- Temperature ranges
- Precipitation chances
- Historical context
- Activity recommendations
- Travel tips
- Air quality if relevant

Now, ensure JSON is exact structure.

Output only JSON, no other text.
