First, I need to analyze the user query: "I need to plan a trip to Paris in December" as of November 13, 2025. I have to use multi-dimensional reasoning and think like a world-class consultant.

**Step 1: WHAT DOES THE USER REALLY WANT?**
- Literally, they want to plan a trip to Paris in December.
- Actual goal: They're likely looking for a comprehensive travel plan, including flights, accommodation, activities, etc., for a December trip.
- Emotional state: Probably excited or anxious about planning, might be stressed if it's last-minute (since it's November 2025 and December is soon).
- This seems like one main request but with multiple sub-tasks involved in trip planning.

**Step 2: INFORMATION QUALITY CHECK - THINK BEYOND THE OBVIOUS**
- If I answer just "plan a trip," it won't be complete. They need details on:
  - Flights and transportation
  - Accommodation
  - Weather and what to pack
  - Things to do and see (attractions, events)
  - Budget and costs
  - Travel documents and requirements (like visas if needed)
  - Safety and health considerations
  - Local customs and language
- What they didn't mention but need: Duration of trip, travel companions, interests (e.g., culture, food, shopping), budget constraints.
- Alternatives: Other times to visit, other destinations, but they specified Paris in December.
- Context: December in Paris might have Christmas markets, holiday events, but also cold weather. Need to consider seasonal factors.
- Multi-dimensional thinking:
  - Explicit need: Trip plan for Paris in December.
  - Implicit needs: Weather-appropriate clothing, event schedules, crowd management, booking tips.
  - Alternatives: Should they consider nearby cities or day trips?
  - Context: Current events in Paris, COVID-19 restrictions if any, travel advisories.
- Mental process: Similar to the laptop example, for trip planning, dimensions include: transportation, lodging, activities, dining, budget, timing, contingencies. So, multiple searches needed.

**Step 3: IS THIS A BUSINESS PROBLEM?**
- The query is about personal travel planning, not directly related to business challenges like customer support automation.
- No indication of business context here; it's a personal query.
- So, business_opportunity detected: false. I should not include rag for Mochan-D context unless it's relevant, but here it's not.

**Step 4: MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TASK BREAKDOWN**
- Literal ask: Plan a trip to Paris in December.
- Implied: Need for detailed, actionable steps.
- Alternatives: Other destinations or times, but user specified Paris and December.
- Related information: Travel tips, packing lists, cultural norms.
- World-class expert would include: Hidden gems, local insights, safety tips, backup plans.
- Dimensions to search:
  1. Weather in Paris December 2025 (time-sensitive)
  2. Flights to Paris December 2025
  3. Hotels in Paris December 2025
  4. Things to do in Paris December 2025 (events, attractions)
  5. Paris travel budget December 2025
  6. Travel requirements for Paris 2025 (visas, COVID rules)
  7. Packing list for Paris winter
  8. Local transportation in Paris
  9. Dining and cuisine in Paris
  10. Safety tips for tourists in Paris
- I should aim for at least 5-7 searches. Let's list them out for web_search since it's time-sensitive.

**Step 5: HOW TO FORMAT QUERIES**
- For web_search: Short, keyword-focused, under 6-8 words, include year 2025.
- For rag: Not needed here as no business context.
- So, only web_search queries.

**Step 6: TOOL ORCHESTRATION**
- Tools available: web_search, rag, calculator.
- Since no business context, rag not needed.
- Calculator might be useful for budget calculations, but user didn't specify numbers yet.
- All web_search queries can run in parallel as there's no dependency.
- Mode: parallel.

**Step 7: HOW SHOULD THE RESPONSE FEEL?**
- User's tone: Casual, seeking help.
- Personality: Helpful, empathetic, excited for their trip.
- Detail level: Comprehensive, since trip planning needs lots of info.
- Language style: Casual English or professional, but since it's personal, casual might be better.
- Sentiment: Primary emotion could be excited or casual, intensity medium.

Now, structure the JSON:

- multi_task_analysis: This is a single task with multiple sub-tasks, so multi_task_detected: true, sub_tasks: descriptions of the planning aspects.
- semantic_intent: Clear description of overall goal.
- expansion_reasoning: Why I'm adding more searches – because trip planning is multi-faceted.
- business_opportunity: Detected false, since it's personal.
- tools_to_use: Only web_search, as rag not needed, calculator might not be used yet.
- tool_execution: Parallel, as no dependencies.
- enhanced_queries: List of web_search queries.
- tool_reasoning: Why these tools – web_search for current info.
- sentiment: Primary emotion, intensity.
- response_strategy: Personality, length, language, tone.
- key_points_to_address: List of points to cover in response.

List out the web_search queries:
- web_search_0: "Paris weather December 2025"
- web_search_1: "Flights to Paris December 2025"
- web_search_2: "Hotels in Paris December 2025"
- web_search_3: "Paris events December 2025"
- web_search_4: "Paris travel budget 2025"
- web_search_5: "France travel requirements 2025"
- web_search_6: "Packing for Paris winter"
- web_search_7: "Paris transportation tips"
- That's 8 searches, which is good for generosity.

For rag, not needed, so omit or set to empty if required, but the structure might expect it. Looking at the JSON, "enhanced_queries" can have rag and web_search. Since no rag, I can skip it or set to null, but better to only include web_search.

In the JSON, "enhanced_queries" is an object with keys like rag_0, web_search_0, etc. So, I'll only include web_search ones.

Now, fill in the JSON:

- multi_task_analysis: multi_task_detected: true, sub_tasks: ["Research weather and climate", "Find flight options", "Book accommodation", "Plan activities and events", "Set budget and costs", "Check travel documents", "Prepare packing list"]
- semantic_intent: "To create a comprehensive travel plan for a trip to Paris in December 2025, including logistics, activities, and preparations."
- expansion_reasoning: "Trip planning involves multiple dimensions such as transportation, accommodation, activities, budget, and seasonal considerations. December in Paris has specific events and weather, so multiple focused searches are needed to provide a complete answer."
- business_opportunity: detected: false, composite_confidence: 0, engagement_level: "pure_empathy" (since no business context), signal_breakdown all 0, recommended_approach: "empathy_first", pain_points and solution_areas empty or not applicable.
- tools_to_use: ["web_search"] – since only web_search is needed.
- tool_execution: mode: "parallel", order: ["web_search_0", "web_search_1", ...] but order might not matter for parallel, so I can list them or just say parallel. The JSON says "order": ["tool1", "tool2"], but for parallel, it might be the order of execution, but since parallel, it doesn't matter. I'll list the tools in some order.
- dependency_reason: empty since parallel.
- enhanced_queries: object with web_search queries.
- tool_reasoning: "Web search is used to gather current and time-sensitive information about weather, flights, accommodations, events, and travel requirements for Paris in December 2025."
- sentiment: primary_emotion: "excited" (assuming), intensity: "medium"
- response_strategy: personality: "helpful_dost" (friendly helper), length: "detailed" (since comprehensive planning), language: "english" (casual or professional? Probably casual), tone: "friendly"
- key_points_to_address: List of main points from the searches.

Ensure JSON structure is exact.

Final check:
- Did I find all dimensions? Yes, covered weather, transport, stay, activities, budget, docs, packing.
- Searches: 8 web_search queries, which is generous.
- Key names: using web_search_0 to web_search_7.
- JSON structure: Follow exactly.

Now, write the JSON.
